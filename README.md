# SmallTrain: The machine learning library enabling "small train", which requires lower machine power and fewer training data.

SmallTrain is a machine learning library running on TensorFlow (and Keras and PyTorch in the future version).
It enables small train, which requires lower machine power and fewer training data because
you can develop your machine learning(ML) models from our pre-trained models.
